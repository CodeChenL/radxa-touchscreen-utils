# RADXA-TOUCHSCREEN-UTILS(8)

## NAME

radxa-map-tp - Map known touch panel to related display

## SYNOPSIS

**radxa-map-tp**

## DESCRIPTION

By default, touch panel is mapped to the entire X11 display
output. This causes confusion to the end user, and behaves
more like a touch pad (as seen on the laptop).

This helper script map the touch panel input to the coresponding
X11 output to achieve expected usr experience.
